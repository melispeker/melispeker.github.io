            <p>① <strong>Variables and Assignments</strong><br>
            ✮ A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value.<br>
            ✮ Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings.<br>
            ✮ It is possible to change the value represented by a variable.<br>
            ✮ The "←" operator can be used to assign a value to a variable.</p>

            <p>② <strong>Data Abstraction</strong><br>
            ✮ An index is a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers.<br>
            ✮ Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation.<br>
            ✮ Data abstraction can be created using lists, which allow bundling of variables like strings, numbers, etc.<br>
            ✮ Developing a data abstraction in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain.</p>

            <p>③ <strong>Mathematical Expressions</strong><br>
            ✮ An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.<br>
            ✮ Algorithms can be expressed in various ways, such as natural language, diagrams, and pseudocode.<br>
            ✮ Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.</p>

            ✮ Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text in programming.<br>
            ✮ A substring is a part of an existing string.<br>
            ✮ They are used for things like names, words, or sentences.<br>
            ✮ You can combine, break apart, and search through strings.</p>

            <p>⑤ <strong>Boolean Expressions</strong><br>
            ✮ A boolean is either true or false.<br>
            ✮ It can have a value of either "1" or "0"<br>
            ✮ It has operators like AND, OR, and NOT.<br>
            ✮ They are commonly used in conditionals and loops.</p>

            <p>⑥ <strong>Conditionals</strong><br>
            ✮ Conditionals are statements in programming that allow the code to make decisions based on certain conditions.<br>
            ✮ They use if, else if, and else for different codes depending on whether a given Boolean expression is true or false.<br>
            ✮ For example:

            -if a condition is true, do something.
            -else if another condition is true, do something else.
            -else do something if none of the conditions are true.</p>

            <p> ⑦ <strong>Nested Conditionals </strong><br>
            ✮ Nested conditionals are conditionals within other conditionals.<br>
            ✮ This means that an if, else if, or else statement contains another conditional inside it.<br>
            ✮ They are used to handle more complex decision-making processes<br>

            <p> ⑧ <strong>Itearation </strong><br>
            ✮ Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm. Iteration repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met.<br>
            ✮ Iteration statements change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met.<br>
            ✮ In REPEAT UNTIL(condition) iteration, is the condition evaluates to true initially, the loop body is not executed at all, due to the condition being checkers before the loop.<br>

            <p> ⑨ <strong>Developing Algorithms</strong><br>
            ✮ Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying.<br>

            <p> ⑩ <strong>Lists</strong><br>
            ✮ For list operation, write expressions that use list indexing and list procedures.<br>
            ✮ For algorithms involving elements of a list, write iteration statements to traverse a list.<br>

            <p> ⑪ <strong>Binary Search</strong><br>
            ✮ Binary search efficiently finds a target in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing it in half.<br>
            ✮ It compares the target to the middle element and searches left or right based on the comparison.<br>
            ✮ Stops when the target is found or no more divisions are possible.<br>
            ✮ Works only on sorted lists<br>

            <p> ⑫ <strong>Calling Procedures</strong><br>
            ✮ Procedures are reusable blocks of code for specific tasks.<br>
            ✮ Calling a procedure runs its code, often with input parameters.<br>
            ✮ Procedures can return values for further use.<br>
            ✮ They reduce repetition and simplify code.<br>

            <p> ⑬ <strong>Developing Procedures</strong><br>
            ✮ Procedures solve tasks by breaking problems into smaller parts.<br>
            ✮ Parameters and clear input/output make them flexible.<br>
            ✮ Test procedures to ensure correctness and handle edge cases.<br>
            ✮ Use comments and documentation for clarity and understanding.<br>

            ✮ Algorithmic efficiency measures how well an algorithm performs as input size increases.<br>
            ✮ Choosing an efficient algorithm improves program performance.<br>

            <p> ⑱ <strong>Undecidable Problems</strong><br>
            ✮ Some problems cannot be solved by any algorithm.<br>
            ✮ An undecidable problem has no algorithm that always leads to a correct yes or no answer.<br>
            ✮ Simulations often use random values to generate different outcomes.<br>

            <h3>How I Created My GitHub Page</h3>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Before AP CSP, I had never used GitHub before. I first opened an account this summer for the CS50 course so I could complete the problem sets. However, it was not until 1 week ago that I started to figure out the basics of GitHub. Now I have finished setting up my site for now. As time goes by, I plan to improve my site with my new knowledge.
            </p>

            <h3>Problems I Encountered</h3>
            <p>
                One of the biggest problems I faced was creating different links so the links redirected to different pages. Then I learned that I needed to create different files for this to be possible. So I went ahead and created different files for every segment I wanted to display. For example, "projects.html" or "swift.html."
            </p>

            <p>Here is a part of my code:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="projects.html"&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="cs50.html"&gt;CS50 Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="swift.html"&gt;Develop in Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="documentation.html"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
