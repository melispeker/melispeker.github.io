            <p>① <strong>Collaboration</strong><br>
            Computing innovations are improved through collaboration.<br>
            Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.</p>

            <p>② <strong>Program Function and Purpose</strong><br>
            The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.<br>
            Understanding the purpose provides developers with a better start to develop their project.</p>

            <p>③ <strong>Program Design and Development</strong><br>
            Investigating, designing, prototyping, and testing are commonly used when developing a program.<br>
            It is very important to include credit when developing a program.</p>

            <p>④ <strong>Identifying and Correcting Errors</strong><br>
            <strong>Logic Error:</strong> A mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly.<br>
            <strong>Syntax Error:</strong> A mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.<br>
            <strong>Run-time Error:</strong> A mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program.<br>
            <strong>Overflow Error:</strong> An error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside the defined range of values.</p>

            <p>① <strong>Binary Numbers</strong><br>
            Data can be represented using bits.<br>
            A byte is a sequence of 8 bits.<br>
            Binary is a number system that uses two digits. "1" represents an electrical signal in your computer being on. "0" represents an electrical signal in your computer being off.</p>

            <p>② <strong>Data Compression</strong><br>
            Lossless data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data.<br>
            Lossy data compression algorithms can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data.<br>
            Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.</p>

            <p>③ <strong>Extracting Information from Data</strong><br>
            Data sets pose challenges such as the need to clean data, incomplete data, invalid data, and the need to combine data sources.</p>

            <p>④ <strong>Using Programs with Data</strong><br>
            Programs are used in an iterative and interactive way when processing information to allow users to gain insight and knowledge about data.<br>
            Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data.</p>

            <p>① <strong>Variables and Assignments</strong><br>
            A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value.<br>
            Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings.<br>
            It is possible to change the value represented by a variable.<br>
            The "←" operator can be used to assign a value to a variable.</p>

            <p>② <strong>Data Abstraction</strong><br>
            An index is a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers.<br>
            Types of variables include strings, lists, and more.<br>
            Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation.<br>
            Data abstraction can be created using lists, which allow bundling of variables like strings, numbers, etc.<br>
            Data abstractions manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation.<br>
            Developing a data abstraction in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain.</p>

            <p>③ <strong>Mathematical Expressions</strong><br>
            An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.<br>
            Beyond visual and textual programming languages, algorithms can be expressed in various ways, such as natural language, diagrams, and pseudocode.<br>
            Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">How I Created My GitHub Page:</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Before AP CSP, I had never used GitHub before. I first opened an account this summer for the CS50 course so I could complete the problem sets. However, it was not until 1 week ago that I started to figure out the basics of GitHub. Now I have finished setting up my site for now. As time goes by, I plan to improve my site with my new knowledge.
            </p>

            <h3>Problems I Encountered</h3>
            <p>
                One of the biggest problems I faced was creating different links so the links redirected to different pages. Then I learned that I needed to create different files for this to be possible. So I went ahead and created different files for every segment I wanted to display. For example, "projects.html" or "swift.html."
            </p>

            <p>Here is a part of my code:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="projects.html"&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="cs50.html"&gt;CS50 Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="swift.html"&gt;Develop in Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="documentation.html"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
