## My name is Melis. I am a 10th grade student at Hisar Schools. I love learning about physics and I plan to pursue a career in this field in the future. My hobbies include fencing, walking, and baking. Recently I have developed an interest for technology and that is why I have chosen to take the CSP AP class. 

# Projects
## Last year I joined Technovation Girls. We developed a mechanical product as a group of 5 girls. We attended the 5. Technovation Launch Event as a group. I also went to Cambridge for the Pi Wars competition and won 3rd place. After that, I went to Farnce for the Eurobot competition.

# CS50 Course
## I completed CS50 Understanding Technology course. I have also completed a few weeks from CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. However, I could not complete the Problem Set assignments since I didn't know how to use Github properly. I took notes as I listened to the lectures and did my best to listen carefully.

# Develop in Swift
## What is Swift? Swift is a programming language created by Apple. It was announced in 2014 and has ben growing fastly since then. What is Programming? Programming consists of inputs and outputs. Inputs are what people provide for the computer. The program tells the computer how to use that information. After working with the inputs, the program produces outputs. What Are Values? The inputs and outputs of a program are the information it works with. This is called data. Data is a collection of individual values. What Are Identifiers? Naming is an important sskill in programming. In programming, you need to create clear, descriptive names -called identifiers- that reveal the intent of your code. What are Constants and Variable? When you create an identifier, you also need to declare whether it's a constant or a variable. The value of a constant doesn't change while the value of a variable way change. How Are Simulations Used? Programmers often use simulations to replicate real-world systen-ms and predict their behaviour. What Are Strings? In most programm≈üng languages, including Swift, text values are called strings and are composed of characters.
